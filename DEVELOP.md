## Install

Run `yarn install` to install the npm dependencies.

## Scripts

Our [`package.json`](package.json) houses a collection of [run-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) that we use to maintain, test, build, and publish the OVH Manager, notably:

-   `split` runs `scripts/split.js`, which generate a subtree branch (from the current one) for the specified package.

### Split a module

```sh
yarn run split --help
```
